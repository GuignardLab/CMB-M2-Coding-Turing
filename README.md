## 1. Roadmap

- Recaps
  - Functions
  - Scripts
- What is a class?
- Why might we need classes?
- How to write a class in Python
- A class for the implementation of Turing patterns
- Bonus: Packaging your code

## 2. Goal of this course

This course aims at teaching the basics of classes using reaction diffusion simulations as a support, more specifically Turing like patterns. Understanding the mathematics or the biology behind Turing patterns is not necessary but it might help to understand better what is happening under the hood.

At the end of the course, I would like you to be able to write classes to do data analysis. Beginer to medium coding knowledge is required though I will do my best to not loose the least experienced ones on our way.

## 3. Some refreshers

### 3.1. Variables

- What is a variable?
- What are the different types of variables?
  - `Integer`
  - `Float`
  - `String`
- Difference between compiled and interpreted?

### 3.2. Data structures

- What are data structures?
- What are they good for?
- Common data structures:
  - `List`
  - `Tuple`
  - `Dictionary`
  - `Set`
  - `np.ndarray`
  - [...]

### 3.3. Conditional statements & loops

- What are conditional statements?
- Bread and butter of coding
- Common conditional statements:
  - `if`
  - `else`
  - `elif`
- What are loops?
- Common loops:
  - `for`
  - `while`

### 3.4. Functions

- What is a function?
  - name
  - arguments
  - return value
- What is it good for?
